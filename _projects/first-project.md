Idea begins for Health Dasth.
What I decided to build was a health tracking dashboard using only my Apple Watch.

I decided to do this after realizing how many data points my watch is collecting and I am only using my 5% of it. I could use so much more of the data for analysis purposes.

Bands like the WHOOP, Garmin, and many other apps all use the same data points to come to the conclusion for rest, recovery, stress, and mental fatigue.

There are a lot of studies that show an ounce of prevention goes further than a ton of a cure. If I can my data points to help prevent future injuries, such as if I am not receiving enough rest for many days in a row, I should take it easy on lifting weights or anything performance related because I will not be at a good point physically for my nervous system to be at an apex point.
